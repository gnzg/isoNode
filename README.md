# IsoNode
IsoNode is inspired by jsISO but has a dedicated state management engine as a single source of truth for easy scale up. It offers map rotation, keyboard map repositioning, zoom (work in progress) and a modular, easy to work with object-oriented approach as well as the comfort of a more timely development framework.
